                <p><mark>1. Now that’s what I call stupid:</mark> In my junior year of high school, this guy asked me on a date. He rented a Redbox
                movie and made a pizza. We were watching the movie and the oven beeped so the pizza was done. He looked me dead in the
                eye and said, “This is the worst part.” I then watched this boy open the oven and pull the pizza out with his bare
                hands, rack and all, screaming at the top of his lungs. We never had a second date.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="stories__fake">
                <p><mark>2. The fake report card:</mark> I failed the first quarter of a class in middle school, so I made a fake report card. I did
                this every quarter that year. I forgot that they mail home the end-of-year cards, and my mom got it before I could
                intercept with my fake. She was PISSED—at the school for their error. The teacher also retired that year and had already
                thrown out his records, so they had to take my mother’s “proof” (the fake ones I made throughout the year) and “correct”
                the “mistake.” I’ve never told her the truth.

                <p><mark>3. All the fish:</mark> I went to this girl’s party the week after she beat the shit out of my friend. While everyone was
                getting trashed, I went around putting tuna inside all the curtain rods and so like weeks went by and they couldn’t
                figure out why the house smelled like festering death. They caught me through this video where these guys at the party
                were singing Beyoncé while I was in the background with a can of tuna.</p>

            <div class="stories__games">
                <p><mark>4. How to win at video games:</mark> When I was little, I would go on Nickelodeon.com all the time and they had this game
                similar to Club Penguin, except it was called Nicktropolis. And if you forgot your password, a security question you
                could choose was “What is your eye color?” and if you got it right it’d tell you your password. So I would go to popular
                locations in Nicktropolis and write down random usernames who were also in those areas, and then I would log out and
                type in the username as if it were my own and see which of these usernames had a security question set to “What is your
                eye color?” (Which was most of them, since it was easy and we were all kids). I would then try either brown, blue, or
                green, and always get in, then I would go to their house and send all of their furniture and decorations to my own
                accounts. And if I didn’t want it, I could sell it for money.</p>
